Welcome to the postpone API! You can use our API to access postpone API endpoints. The postpone API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.

We also use HTTP verbs (methods) POST, GET, PUT, and DELET. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively.

[JSON](http://www.json.org/) will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.
